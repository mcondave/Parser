This will be a repository for extending a parser written in a class.


----------------------- TO DO -----------------------

string type
things I can think of
other cool stuff




----------------------- INFO -----------------------

This project is an extension of a homework project for a programming class. Most of the code for the scanner/parser was supplied but with holes that needed
to be filled in. I've started with a completed version of the assignment. It was able to scan and parse a simple language and give outputs such as the token
type and value. The aim of this project is to extend it into a more fleshed out language to demonstrate understanding of programming language structure and
for some good programming experience.

Things need to be thoroughly tested so negative cases are caught.


----------------------- COMPLETED (OR SO I THINK) -----------------------

parsing doubles
array declaration
defining functions


----------------------- ACTUALLY COMPLETED -----------------------
